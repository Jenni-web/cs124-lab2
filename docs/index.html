        <p>This shows a user typing a new task to add it to the empty list. Note that
        if input is longer than the text box, it will automatically scroll to let user
        see what they are typing.
        <br>
        After typing, user can push the "Add" button next to the text box.</p>
    </div>

    <h3></h3>
    <div class="task">
        <iframe src="before3.html" class="image" height="640" width="360"></iframe>
        <p>This shows the screen with some items added. User can mark a task completed by
            tapping/clicking on to the task, but not on the text of the task, because that
            allows a user to rename the task.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="task">
        <iframe src="during4.1.html" class="image" height="640" width="360"></iframe>
        <p>This shows the screen when the user clicks on the text of a task. Note that the font
        and size of the text are different from a task that we are not renaming. This is so that
        the user knows that the task is being renamed.
