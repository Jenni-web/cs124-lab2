        <p>This shows a user typing a new task to add it to the empty list. Note that
        if input is longer than the text box, it will automatically scroll to let user

    <h3></h3>
    <div class="task">

        <p>This shows the screen with some items added. User can mark a task completed by
            tapping/clicking on to the task, but not on the text of the task, because that
            allows a user to rename the task.</p>
    </div>

        <p>This shows the screen when the user clicks on the text of a task. Note that the font
        and size of the text are different from a task that we are not renaming. This is so that
        the user knows that the task is being renamed.
